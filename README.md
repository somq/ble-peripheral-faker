## Features

**ble-peripheral-faker is build on top of [bleno](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/bleno)**.

> Simply build a JSON file respecting the [described format](#usage) and the module will care of mouting a gatt server as a ble peripheral with random values to read and notifies at random times from your JSON file.

- Ble peripheral
  - Custom services and characteristics from the JSON file
  - Automatic random values to read and notified from an array in the JSON file
  - Notifies are triggered by a random timer using a min and a max value set in the JSON file

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/somq/ble-peripheral-faker.git
cd ble-peripheral-faker
npm i
npm start -- example-peripheral.json
```

Troubleshoot

> Under the hood, this tool uses a [fork](https://github.com/abandonware/bleno) of [Bleno](https://github.com/noble/bleno)  
> In case of dependency build/start issue, please refer to the [Bleno docs](https://github.com/abandonware/bleno#bleno)  
> A good starting point is to install [core dependencies](https://github.com/abandonware/bleno#prerequisites) and rebuild dependencies with `npm rebuild`

## Usage

JSON file must respect the following format:

```json

## Todo

Implement random automatic response on write when writeWithoutResponse is false.
